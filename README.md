## Project

The goal of this project was to create a seamless experience for both the user and the restaurant to be able place and recieve orders online. 

For both the user and restaurant admin you are greeted with a clean homepage. From here, the user can click a button to view the menu, create an order, enter their information and place their order. If the order is successful, they will be redirected to a confirmation page where it will live reload once the restaurant confirms the order with an estimated time. The user will also recieve a text informing them of the estimated time. This process repeats when the restaurant completes the order.

As for the restaurant, they will click on the admin button, login in, and be greeted with all pending and in process orders. When a user creates a new order, the resturant will be informed via a text message. They can confirm an order with an estimated time, and when finished complete the order.
